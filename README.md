This is a project from the Jonas Schmedtmann React course on Udemy.

What it does:
-Creates a packing list webapp that has a form to input an item and quantity of said item into the list.

-Lets you check off items in the list, which marks through the text (checkbox), delete items from the list(red 'x'), and keeps track of finished % for the list.
